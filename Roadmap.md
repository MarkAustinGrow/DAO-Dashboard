# Roadmap: Configuring Marvin and the DAO Dashboard

This roadmap provides a step-by-step guide for integrating Marvin (the DAO overseer) into our system and configuring the DAO dashboard. Follow these steps to set up the environment, build Marvin's service, integrate the dashboard, test the workflow, and deploy the solution.

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment ✅

1. **Create a New Branch** ✅
   - Start a new branch in your repository for the DAO/Marvin integration work.

2. **Configure Environment Variables** ✅
   - Ensure your Supabase database URL, API keys, and other credentials are set as environment variables.
   - Verify that your development environment can connect to Supabase (e.g., using a Supabase client library).

3. **Install Necessary Packages** ✅
   - For backend development, install your preferred PostgreSQL client (e.g., `pg` for Node.js or `psycopg2` for Python) and the Supabase SDK.
   - For real-time updates, install packages for WebSockets or use Supabase's built-in real-time features.

---

## Step 2: Build Marvin as a Service ❌

1. **Define Marvin's Role** ❌
   - Marvin will:
     - Monitor DAO proposals.
     - Create and update tasks in the `tasks` table.
     - Log each action in the `activity_logs` table.
   - Prepare functions for:
     - Fetching new or updated proposals.
     - Creating tasks based on proposals (e.g., "remove a YouTube video").
     - Logging every action.

2. **Create a New Service/Module for Marvin** ❌
   - Create a file/module (e.g., `marvin.js` or `marvin.py`) dedicated to Marvin's functionality.
   - **Example (Node.js):**

     ```js
     const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
     const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;
     const supabaseKey = process.env.SUPABASE_KEY;
     const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

     // Fetch proposals that need action
     async function fetchPendingProposals() {
       const { data, error } = await supabase
         .from('proposals')
         .select('*')
         .eq('status', 'open');
       if (error) console.error('Error fetching proposals:', error);
       return data;
     }

     // Create a new task based on a proposal
     async function createTaskFromProposal(proposal) {
       const task = {
         title: `Action for Proposal ${proposal.id}`,
         description: proposal.description,
         assigned_to: 'Angus', // For example, assign to Angus
         status: 'pending',
         metadata: { proposalId: proposal.id }
       };

       const { data, error } = await supabase
         .from('tasks')
         .insert(task)
         .single();
       if (error) console.error('Error creating task:', error);
       else await logActivity('task_created', task);
       return data;
     }

     // Log an event in activity_logs
     async function logActivity(action, details) {
       const logEntry = {
         entity: 'Marvin',
         action,
         details: JSON.stringify(details)
       };
       const { data, error } = await supabase
         .from('activity_logs')
         .insert(logEntry);
       if (error) console.error('Error logging activity:', error);
       return data;
     }

     // Main loop/scheduler for Marvin
     async function runMarvin() {
       const proposals = await fetchPendingProposals();
       for (const proposal of proposals) {
         await createTaskFromProposal(proposal);
         // Optionally update the proposal status
         await supabase
           .from('proposals')
           .update({ status: 'voting' })
           .eq('id', proposal.id);
       }
     }

     // Run periodically (e.g., every minute)
     setInterval(runMarvin, 60000);
     ```

3. **Test Marvin's Functions** ❌
   - Run the service locally and verify:
     - Marvin fetches proposals.
     - Tasks are created correctly in the `tasks` table.
     - Actions are logged in the `activity_logs` table.

---

## Step 3: Configure the DAO Dashboard ✅

1. **Connect the Front End to the Database** ✅
   - Ensure the dashboard reads data from the `tasks`, `proposals`, and `activity_logs` tables.
   - Use RESTful endpoints or Supabase's real-time subscriptions to update the UI when the database changes.

2. **Build UI Components** ✅
   - **Tasks Panel:** ✅
     - Display active tasks (e.g., `pending`, `in_progress`).
     - Show details such as title, description, assigned agent, priority, and timestamps.
   - **Proposals Section:** ✅
     - List DAO proposals with current statuses.
     - Allow community members to view details and cast votes.
   - **Activity Feed:** ✅
     - Display log entries from `activity_logs` (entity, action, details).
     - Format entries for clear readability.

3. **Implement Real-Time Updates** ✅
   - Use Supabase's real-time subscriptions to listen for changes in the tasks table:

   ```js
   supabase
     .from('tasks')
     .on('*', payload => {
       console.log('Change received!', payload);
       // Update dashboard state with new data
     })
     .subscribe();
   ```

4. **Dashboard Layout & Navigation** ✅
   - Organize the dashboard into clear sections:
     - Summary View: Key metrics (active tasks, pending proposals, etc.).
     - Detailed Views: Separate panels for tasks, proposals, and activity logs.

---

## Step 4: Integrate and Test the End-to-End Workflow ⚠️

1. **Simulate a Governance Cycle** ⚠️
   - Create a new proposal manually (or via the UI).
   - Verify that Marvin picks up the proposal and creates a corresponding task.
   - Confirm that the task appears on the dashboard and an activity log entry is generated.
   - Update the task status (simulate completion) and verify dashboard/log updates.

2. **Implement Error Handling & Notifications** ✅
   - Log any errors during task creation or updates.
   - Optionally, display notifications on the dashboard for failures or manual intervention needs.

3. **Review Performance and Data Integrity** ⚠️
   - Ensure that foreign keys and relationships (e.g., tasks to agents, proposals) are maintained.
   - Verify that timestamps are accurate and logs provide a complete audit trail.

---

## Step 5: Deployment and Ongoing Maintenance ✅

1. **Deploy Marvin's Service** ⚠️
   - Deploy the updated code to the production environment.
   - Set up monitoring and logging (using Supabase logs or a dedicated logging service).

2. **Monitor Dashboard Feedback** ⚠️
   - Gather community feedback on the DAO dashboard.
   - Refine UI components and functionality based on user input.

3. **Plan for Iteration** ⚠️
   - As governance needs evolve, add features such as:
     - More complex proposal voting.
     - Additional task types and priorities.
     - Enhanced analytics for DAO activity.

4. **Documentation** ✅
   - Document the workflow for future developers.
   - Ensure code for Marvin, API endpoints, and dashboard components is well-commented.
